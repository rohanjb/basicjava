Here is my first session notes for the java class. 
In the first class, we learned about a computer is equal to hardware+software. We compared the structure and parts of a computer with things that we humans have and do every day. For example, we learned about the hardwares of the computer. The CPU (central processing unit) is the brain of the computer and the more CPU’s the computer has, the faster the computer works. Just like if we ask a question to a person, he or she will answer in sometime, but if we ask the same question to 3 people at the same time, then the question will be answered faster. The RAM (random access memory) is like the scratch pad of the computer. If we are asked a hard and complex question like a mathematical question, we will need a notebook and pen. In the same way, the RAM is the scratch pad of the computer. The Hard Disc. This is like if we are given a number or email of someone, we will write it down and save it for later. That is what a hard disc does in a computer.

The software of the computer is what makes an app, the app it is. For example, Google Docs is an app. We do not play games on it or watch videos on it. We type essays or stories on it. It is the software of the app that only lets you type in it, and not anything else. There is also a special software that starts the device. It is called the OS(operating system). Some examples of some OS’s are ios 6, 7, 8, etc., windows 10, linux, marshmallow, lollipop. The program of the computer is the instructions the computer or app will follow to do the certain thing. The program is nothing but the software. Just like we are given instructions to do homework or babysit your sibling, the app follows the binary system.
